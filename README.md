# My-Portfolio
I’m Sinura Damsath Perera, a student web developer from Sri Lanka. I enjoy creating modern, responsive websites and web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the MERN stack. I love experimenting with design, solving problems through code, and continuously improving my skills by working on projects and competitions.
